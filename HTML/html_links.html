                A planet is a large, rounded astronomical body that is neither a star nor its remnant. The best available
                 theory of planet formation is the nebular hypothesis, which posits that an interstellar cloud collapses 
                 out of a nebula to create a young protostar orbited by a protoplanetary disk. Planets grow in this disk 
                 by the gradual accumulation of material driven by gravity, a process called accretion. The Solar System 
                 has at least eight planets: the terrestrial planets Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, and the giant planets 
                 Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. These planets each rotate around an axis tilted with respect to its 
                 orbital pole. All of them possess an atmosphere, although that of Mercury is tenuous, and some share such 
                 features as ice caps, seasons, volcanism, hurricanes, tectonics, and even hydrology. Apart from Venus and Mars, 
                 the Solar System planets generate magnetic fields, and all except Venus and Mercury have natural satellites. 
                 The giant planets bear planetary rings, the most prominent being those of Saturn.

                <p id="Section1">The word planet probably comes from the Greek planḗtai, meaning "wanderers". In antiquity, 
                    this word referred to the Sun, Moon, and five points of light visible by the naked eye that 
                    moved across the background of the stars—namely, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. 
                    Historically, planets have had religious associations: multiple cultures identified celestial 
                    bodies with gods, and these connections with mythology and folklore persist in the schemes for 
                    naming newly discovered Solar System bodies. Earth itself was recognized as a planet when 
                    heliocentrism supplanted geocentrism during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
